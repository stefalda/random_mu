# Random Muu(sic)

<img src="./assets/icon_round_purple.png" alt="App Icon" width="200" height="200">

Random Muu is a simple, yet powerful music player app written in Flutter. It
leverages the Subsonic API to provide a seamless music experience, allowing you
to quickly play random songs from various categories. The app supports quick
song selection with options such as:

- **All Random**
- **Random by Artist**
- **Random by Playlist**
- **Random by Favorites**
- **Random by Albums**
- **Random by Playing**

Currently, the app has been tested on **Web** and **Android** platforms, with
**Navidrome** as the Subsonic-compatible server.

The app should be considered a POC, I've scaffolded the code using different
LLMs (ChatGPT and Claude), to check how they perform but some code could be
optimized.

## Features

  artist, playlist, or favorites.
